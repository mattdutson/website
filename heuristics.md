# Heuristics

Some good rules of thumb, given roughly in order of importance. This list is expected to grow as I continue to learn things.

1.  **Be kind.**
2.  **Don't waste time solving the wrong problem well.** Credit to Michael Gleicher for this phrasing. Another version: "Don't start climbing until you're sure you have the right ladder."
3.  **Simplicity is its own utility.** Simplicity isn't everything - there are times when increased complexity is worthwhile. However, complexity has costs that are easily overlooked. That pineapple-peeling kitchen gadget might be more efficient than a chef's knife, but you have to pay for it, find somewhere to store it, and fix it when it breaks.
4.  **Create a blueprint before starting a project.** Applies to writing, programming, visual design, and building houses. I'm not sure if it applies to life.
5.  **Optimize the common case.** A minute saved on a daily task is better than an hour saved on a yearly task (about six times better, in fact).
6.  **Know your audience.** See also the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).
7.  **Effective communication requires deliberate effort.** Being good at something doesn't make you good at explaining that thing.
8.  **Use books to learn ideas.** I find that physical books encourage slow, deliberate thought. And, they don't have advertisements.
9.  **Use the internet to learn technologies.** That C++ book you bought is going to be obsolete in three years when the next version of the language is released.
10. **Your PowerPoint slides are not your talk.** I can read the words on your slides myself.
11. **Not everything is an object.** I am referring to object-oriented programming, although there may be some metaphysical truth to this.
12. **Try classical methods before using a deep neural network.** Explainability is often important. Also, see heuristic 3.
