# About

I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, a small town near the Idaho border with rounded, brownish mountains on one side and marshes on the other. Some facts about Brigham City: it has a steakhouse that raises its own buffalo, it grows good peaches, and it's named after a prominent 19th century polygamist.

I earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I decided to switch to computer science after realizing that I wasn't about to solve any of the remaining problems in physics. I'm currently a CS graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; if you want to know more about that, read [my CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

As of 2019 I'm married to the lovely Itzel Estrella, who has taught me many things I would not have thought to teach myself. We have a leopard gecko named Monty who has only bitten me once.

I enjoy spending time outdoors: downhill skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. I like simple, well-made things and people who work to make the world better without expecting to be praised. I care a great deal about sustainability and human rights.

If you've made it this far, I assume it's because you care about Matt the Human and not just Matt the Programmer. I don't do social media, but I do have a personal blog at [blog.mattdutson.net](https://blog.mattdutson.net). It isn't indexed by search engines because I don't want recruiters or the internet masses poring over my personal life. If we don't know each other, please don't click the link. If we would be friends on Facebook, then go ahead.
