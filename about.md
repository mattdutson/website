# About

I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, a small town near the Idaho border with rounded, brownish mountains on one side and marshes on the other. Some facts about Brigham City: it has a steakhouse that raises its own buffalo, it grows good peaches, and it's named after a prominent 19th century polygamist.

I earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. I decided to switch to computer science after realizing that I wasn't about to solve any of the remaining problems in physics. I'm currently a CS graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; if you want to know more about that, read [my CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

I enjoy spending time outdoors: downhill skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. I like simple, well-made things and people who make the world better without expecting to be praised. I care a great deal about sustainability and human rights.

As of 2019 I'm married to the lovely Itzel Estrella. She has taught me many things I would not have thought to teach myself. We have a leopard gecko named Monty who has only bitten me once.

I don't do social media, but I do have a personal blog at [blog.mattdutson.net](https://blog.mattdutson.net). It isn't indexed by search engines because I don't want recruiters or the internet masses poring over my personal life. If we don't know each other, please don't click the link. -->
